Here goes yet another string manipulation package.

# Another one!?

Well, there are many other string npm packages, like `string` and others. `stri` contains functionality that I need, but other packages miss. Only a handful of functions, but useful ones.

# Installation

`npm i stri -S`

# Usage

To have all functions at your disposal, import it and then do this in your main:

`Stri.includeMe()`

After that all methods will be available as `String` members.
